# School_District_Analaysis
## Overview 
After completing the school district analysis for Maria and her supervisor, they were notified by the school board that the [students_complete.csv](https://github.com/Bulzeye89/School_District_Analaysis/blob/main/Resources/students_complete.csv) contained data for which there was of evidence of academic dishonesty.  Specifically, math and reading grades for the ninth graders at Thomas High School are in question.  In order to uphold state-testing standards, they have asked Maria to remove these students grades while keeping the rest of the data intact.  Maria in turn, has asked me to replace these students grades with Nans and repeat the analysis to discover if this potential academic dishonsesty has any impact on the results.  



## Results
After refactoring the original code to replace Thomas High school ninth graders reading and math scores, we reviewed the results and saw that was only miniscule changes.  The image shows the district summary dataframe with the scores included,
